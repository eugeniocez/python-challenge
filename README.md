# python-challenge

This is the repo for Module 3 Challenge

The code was done with the material learned during class, reviewing the zoom recordings and also with help of ChatGPT.

For the first activity "PyBank", I mainly used AI to help me understand how to determine the variables of greatest increase and greatest decrease. Finally I also did not know how to export the results to a text file and asked ChatGPT how to do it.

For the second activity "PyPoll", I first had a mistake with the candidates variables, and upon asking ChatGPT, I learned I mistakenly used a list instead of a dictionary. Then I also used AI to determine how to format the percentage as a floating point number with decimal places.
